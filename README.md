## Why?

The primary motivation behind this project is to deepen my understanding and proficiency in developing Express apps with a MongoDB database. More specifically, I got practical skill and experience in...
- Creating skeleton websites with Express Application Generator
- Starting and stopping a Node web server
- Using a MongoDB database to store my application's data
- Creating a CRUD(create, read, update, delete) interface
- Create routes for requesting information
- Using MVC(model, view, controller) pattern to implement user interface, data, and controlling logic
- Deploying my application to production in a secure way
